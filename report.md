The things i like a about this programm i made:

1. The date initialization function 'python main.py init'. Instead of simply having a date in a text file, as the assignment suggests. This creates a new date, every time you run it. So even if you try the code again one year later, this again gives a current date, so you won't always have to work in last year. By using the timedelta's and the options to go back and forth between datetime objects and strings, the "day.csv" file is an important part.

2. The report section is a collection of if statements and i'm glad it works like it should. Also the graphs are posible so it shows you what your profit and revenue is. Products can be added to the inventory list. 

3. It was a big task en i'm glad it reacts like it sould but python is verry dificult and i need to learn more about it if i want to use it in other projects. It has his benefits and i now that it is the new hype for coding. But it is still a dificult programm language to use. So for the future a i'm gone learn more about this stuff. for now i'm glad it is done.
